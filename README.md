## Overview

This crate provides attribute macros for specifying API stability of public API items of a crate. For a quick example:

```rust
/// This function does something really risky!
///
/// Don't use it yet!
#[stability::unstable(feature = "risky-function")]
pub fn risky_function() {
    unimplemented!()
}
```

Please check out the [documentation] for detailed usage.
